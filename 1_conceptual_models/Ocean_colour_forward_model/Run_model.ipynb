    "# Ocean Colour Forward Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* To learn how the colour of water is affected by its constituents and hence how optical remote sensing can be used to estimate concentrations of chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended particulate matter (TSM) and related parameters!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes in the concentration of chlorophyll (Chl), coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and non-algae particles (NAP, e.g. sediment) in water have a marked effect on its colour. These changes are measurable by us, as observers, and by ocean colour satellites. When we know the concentrations of these consituents, **forward modelling** allows us to simulate the spectrally dependant inherent optical properties of the consituents (primarily absorption and scattering), and in turn determine the reflectance, the apparent optical property we typically measure from space and with in situ radiometry instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we construct a forward model based on three consituents; Chl, CDOM (measured at 443 nm) and NAP. By varying these quantities we are able to see the resulting changes in the absorption (*a*), backscattering (*b*) and remote sensing reflectance (*R$_{rs}$*) spectra observed at the ocean surface. This can give an understanding of how the ocean colour signal can vary, how sensitive it is to changes in different constituents, and how it might be exploited through multi and hyperspectral satellite measurements and geophysical retrieval algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "This ocean colour model gives a first order understanding of variability of ocean colour as function of chlorophyll a concentration, non-algae particle concentration and Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter absorption. It is based on an approximate reflectance model assuming no bottom reflectance, no inelastic scattering, vertically homogeneity and a fixed model for specific inherent optical properties. It is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for ocean colour data processing or for research grade ocean colour publications. For the latter full radiative transfer simulations should be made, e.g. using HYDROLIGHT (water), 6SV (atmosphere) or similar models!\n",
